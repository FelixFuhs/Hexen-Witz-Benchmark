# data/raw_data/
# data/interim_data/
# notebooks/ # if notebooks are not part of the runnable app
*.md # READMEs, etc. are not needed in the final image unless used by the app
# Keep .md files for now, as prompts are .md
# However, if prompts are packaged with `src`, then this could be broader.
# For now, be specific about outputs.
# If there are .env files with secrets, they should be here too,
# but secrets are better handled via Docker secrets or build-time env vars.
