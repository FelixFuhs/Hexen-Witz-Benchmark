# Tests for Pydantic models will be implemented here.
# Example ideas:
# - Test successful creation of each model with valid data.
# - Test validation errors for JudgeScore fields (ge/le constraints).
# - Test datetime parsing/handling if default factories are used or complex validation exists.
# - Test that TypedDict OpenRouterResponse works as expected (though less to test than BaseModel).
