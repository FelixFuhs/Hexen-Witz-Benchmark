from unittest import mock # For mocking async functions and classes

from src.main import run_benchmark
from src.config import Settings
# Import other necessary modules from src that might be needed for mocking
# e.g., src.generator, src.judge, src.storage.files, src.storage.database

# Tests for main.py orchestration logic will be implemented here.

# Example test ideas for main.py:
# - test_run_benchmark_happy_path:
#   - Mock all external calls (generator, judge, storage, client).
#   - Verify that run_benchmark calls them in the correct order with expected parameters.
#   - Verify meta.json is written, DB is initialized.
# - test_run_benchmark_no_models_uses_default:
#   - Check if default models are used when models_to_run is None.
# - test_run_benchmark_db_failure:
#   - Mock create_connection or execute_ddl to fail.
#   - Verify the run aborts gracefully.
# - test_run_benchmark_budget_exceeded_in_generator:
#   - Mock generator.run_generations_for_model to raise BudgetExceededError.
#   - Verify the run handles this and proceeds to judging or stops as designed.
# - test_run_benchmark_budget_exceeded_in_judge:
#   - Mock judge.judge_response to raise BudgetExceededError.
#   - Verify the run handles this.
# - test_run_benchmark_file_processing_errors:
#   - Mock loading of raw JSON to fail for one file.
#   - Verify it continues with other files.
# - test_run_benchmark_custom_config_file:
#   - Pass a dummy config_file path and check if Settings loads it (might need to mock Settings).

    )

# More complex fixtures will be needed to mock the behavior of various components
# called by run_benchmark. For example, mocking the RouterClient and its chat method,
# mocking file system operations, and database interactions.
